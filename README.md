# cms_from_scratch
Basic CMS implementation built from scratch following an online tutorial written by Matt Doyle.

The tutorial, called <a href="http://www.elated.com/articles/cms-in-an-afternoon-php-mysql/">Build a CMS in an afternoon using PHP and MySQL</a> was pretty simple, but offers a nice opportunity to start working with PHP.

Not planning on keping this live on my local box so I am archiving off into GitHub in case I ever want to pull it back down as an exmaple.
